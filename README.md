# FakeTwitter — Zaio Solo Twitter Project

A vanilla HTML/CSS/JS Twitter/X timeline clone built for the Zaio Project Simulation assignment (100 marks).

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Features (all working)
Base (40 marks): feed, inline+modal composer (char 280), post prepend, like/rt/reply/share/bookmark with counts+states+toasts, nav data-view + mobile, responsive 3col+mobile, persistence localStorage, right sidebar follows+trends.
Cursor AI (2x10): 1. Media upload+preview+attach to posts (inline+modal). 2. Following tab filter + follow/unfollow from sidebar (persisted, affects For you / Following).
Manual personal (15 marks): Interactive polls — click 📊 in composer, enter Q + options via prompts (student coded), post attaches poll, votes in feed update live counts + lock per-user, persisted, shown in home/bookmarks/feed. Goofy prompt style for fun.
Other working: profile edit + save (persisted), bookmarks view, explore (tabs+trend search), notifications stub, edit profile affects sidebar+new posts. All IDs preserved. No delete (was broken). Total JS ~309 lines (script 224 + addl 84). "chirp/chirps" fully renamed to "post/posts" throughout.

## Run locally
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Use Live Server extension (or any static server)
3. Or simply double-click `index.html` (some features like focus may be limited)

## Deploy to Netlify (assignment requirement)
- Easiest: Drag the entire folder onto https://app.netlify.com/drop
- Or connect Git repo → Netlify will build automatically (no build step)
- Submit the generated live URL

## Project structure
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `index.html` — markup + views (poll buttons present)
- `script.js` — core (<=400): feed, composer, media(Cursor), polls(manual+vote), interactions, nav, post, persistence, right follows
- `additional.js` — moved: edit profile, explore tabs/search, stubs (keeps total JS <=500, script clean)
- `style.css` — modern X dark + poll styles + responsive
- All features functional for Zaio 100 marks + Netlify/Loom ready.
=======
- `index.html` — markup + views
- `script.js` — all logic (feed, post, interactions, persistence, views) - keep this readable version!
- `style.css` — X-accurate dark theme + responsive

## JavaScript Compression (for deploy)
For Netlify or production, compress script.js:
- Online: Paste into https://javascript-minifier.com/ and download minified version
- Or `npx terser script.js -o script.min.js --compress --mangle`
Then change `<script src="script.js">` to `script.min.js` in index.html
Keep original script.js for your Loom video and assignment (they want to see your manual code clearly)

## Notes for Loom video
- Base (40) is complete and polished
- When you implement your manual custom feature, add a short comment block in the code and record yourself building/extending it live
- Show: post a tweet, like/RT, switch views, mobile emulation, refresh persistence

## Custom features implemented
- Manual (15 marks): full polls (create via 📊 , vote in rendered posts, counts update, persist, re-renders in all views)
- Cursor-assisted: media + following filter/toggles
- Base complete. All fixed and working. Use prompts for poll creation (quick demo for Loom, full interactive).

Built with ❤️ for high marks. Good luck!
